    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-answer"> Websites are vulnerable to many possible treats. To best prepare for this, i would recommend focusing on security from the start. Designers, programmers and security specialists should work together from start to finish.
    <p>A concrete way you can secure your site can be to choose servers that are known to focus on security.
       Choosing the right framework to build your site securely and functional, will be our job. We will keep track of possible threats and deploy countermeasures.</p>  
    <p>We recommend that the site be configured to use HTTPS, This will encrypt user data, and make it harder to access. </p>
    <p>Setting up a secure two factor login is recommended. This coupled with strong password requirements will make exploiting harder. 
       We recommend only storing the data you absolutely need and displaying the bare minimum of information to the customer. I.e. only the last four digits of the credit card</p>
