      <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
      <h2>Web Security</h2>
      <p id="web-security-answer"> Websites are vulnerable to many possible treats. To best prepare for this, I would recommend focusing on security from the start. Designers, programmers, and security specialists should work together.</p>
      <p>A concrete way you can secure your site can be to choose servers that are known to focus on security. We recommend only storing the data you absolutely need and displaying the bear minimum of information to the customer. I.e., only the last four digits of the credit card.</p>  
      <p>Choosing the right framework to build your site securely and functional, will be our job. We will keep track of possible threats and deploy countermeasures. Even small changes can leave the site vulnerable, we will therefor utilize Continuous Deployment/Continuous Integration to make sure the code is safe to deploy. Also, a regular security check of the site on website vulnerability scanners is a good practice. </p>
      <p>We recommend that the site be configured to use HTTPS. This will encrypt user data and make it harder to access. Setting up a secure two factor login is recommended. This coupled with strong password requirements will make exploiting harder. Adding automatic logout for inactive users, will also help protect your customers.</p>
      <p>Looking forward to our meeting, and discussing your wishes for a secure, beautiful, and intuitive website.</p>
